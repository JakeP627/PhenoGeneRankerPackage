Description: This package is a gene/disease prioritization tool that utilizes 
    heterogeneous gene disease network. PhenoGeneRanker allows multi-layer gene
    and disease networks. It also calculates empirical p-values of gene ranking
    using random stratified sampling of genes based on their connectivity degree 
    in the network.
